1. I will be working alone. I plan on working on this project whenever possible, probably in between classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays or about 6 hours a week.

2. I am going to use Salary_Data from Mohith Sai Ram Reddy and others.

3. 
Null Hypothesis:
For the dataset, an individual's sex will have no effect on salary.
For the dataset, an individual's work experience will have no effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's age will have no effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's education level will have no effect on salary.

Alt Hypothesis:
For the dataset, an individual's sex will have an effect on salary.
For the dataset, an individual's work experience will have an effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's age will have an effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's education level will have an effect on salary.

4. I plan on using linear regresstion first on the dataset as salary is a continuous variable rather than a discrete one.
