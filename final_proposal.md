1. I will be working alone. I plan on working on this project whenever possible, probably in between classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays or about 6 hours a week.

2. I am going to use Salary_Data from Mohith Sai Ram Reddy and others.

3. 
* Null Hypothesis:
For the dataset, an individual's sex will have no effect on salary.
For the dataset, an individual's work experience will have no effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's age will have no effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's education level will have no effect on salary.

* Alt Hypothesis:
For the dataset, an individual's sex will have an effect on salary.
For the dataset, an individual's work experience will have an effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's age will have an effect on salary.
For a dataset, and individual's education level will have an effect on salary.

4. I plan on using linear regresstion first on the dataset as salary is a continuous variable rather than a discrete one. Also as one variable goes up (e.g., work experience, age, education level) salary might either go up or down in a continuous manner. I will probably use logistic for sex as in this dataset can be class is classified discretely as male, female, and other.
